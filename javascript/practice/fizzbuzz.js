// If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print fizzbuzz

//Plan : Whrn user enters a number
//start looping from 1
//If the number is divisible by 3, print fizz
//If number is divisible by 5 print buzz
//if number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz

//Step 1 : ASking user for a input
let answer=parseInt(prompt('lease enter a number you want to fizz upto: '))
